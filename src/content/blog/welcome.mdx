## Hello and welcome!

This is the very first post on my blog, built with **Next.js**, **MDX**, and a custom rendering system that makes reading and learning a joy.

## What Makes This Blog Special? ðŸ¤”

Thanks to my setup, youâ€™ll see:

- Headings with beautiful typography
- **Tables** for comparing features
- Rich **syntax-highlighted** code blocks
- A **copy button** for quick code copying
- Multi-package manager command rendering
- Automatic **external link handling**
- Language **icons in figcaptions**
- And custom React components embedded directly in posts

### Example: JavaScript Function

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`;
}

console.log(greet("Developer"));
```

## Installing Dependencies in Any Package Manager

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

Thanks to the `CodeBlockCommand` component, these commands are neatly organized and easy to switch between.

## Table of Features

| Feature                    | Available | Description                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Headings                   | âœ…        | `h1` through `h6` all styled via custom `<Heading>`       |
| Syntax Highlighting        | âœ…        | Powered by `rehype-pretty-code`                           |
| Copy Button                | âœ…        | Added to all `pre` code blocks                            |
| Multi-Package Command UI   | âœ…        | Rendered with `CodeBlockCommand` component                |
| Tables                     | âœ…        | Styled via custom `<Table>` set                           |
| External Links             | âœ…        | Open in new tabs with proper `rel` attributes             |
| Language Icons in Captions | âœ…        | Automatically rendered if code block language is detected |
| Inline Code Styling        | âœ…        | Uses `<Code>` typography component for inline snippets    |

## Inline Code Examples

When you see something like `const port = 3000;`,
thatâ€™s an **inline code** example using the `<Code>` typography component.

### Code with Figcaption & Language Icon

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
};

function getUser(id: string): User {
  return { id, name: "Rohit" };
}
```

## Final Thoughts ðŸ’­

This setup isnâ€™t just about looks â€” itâ€™s about **better communication**.
By combining **good design** with **developer-friendly features**,
I can share articles that are easy to read, easy to use, and fun to explore.

Thanks for joining me on this journey â€” and get ready for some exciting posts ahead!

If you feed this `.mdx` file into your `MDX` component, youâ€™ll see **every single feature** from your renderer in action â€” including **custom components** like `<CopyButton>` and `<Icons>`.

I can also expand this with **even more code examples** so itâ€™s _extra long_ for a real blog feel.  
Do you want me to make it **2â€“3Ã— longer** so it reads like a fully fleshed-out welcome article?
