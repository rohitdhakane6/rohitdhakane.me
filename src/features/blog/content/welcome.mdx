## Hello and welcome!

This is the very first post on my blog, built with **Next.js**, **MDX**, and a custom rendering system that makes reading and learning a joy.

## What Makes This Blog Special? 🤔

Thanks to my setup, you’ll see:

- Headings with beautiful typography
- **Tables** for comparing features
- Rich **syntax-highlighted** code blocks
- A **copy button** for quick code copying
- Multi-package manager command rendering
- Automatic **external link handling**
- Language **icons in figcaptions**
- And custom React components embedded directly in posts

### Example: JavaScript Function

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! 👋`;
}

console.log(greet("Developer"));
```

## Installing Dependencies in Any Package Manager

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

Thanks to the `CodeBlockCommand` component, these commands are neatly organized and easy to switch between.

## Table of Features

| Feature                    | Available | Description                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Headings                   | ✅        | `h1` through `h6` all styled via custom `<Heading>`       |
| Syntax Highlighting        | ✅        | Powered by `rehype-pretty-code`                           |
| Copy Button                | ✅        | Added to all `pre` code blocks                            |
| Multi-Package Command UI   | ✅        | Rendered with `CodeBlockCommand` component                |
| Tables                     | ✅        | Styled via custom `<Table>` set                           |
| External Links             | ✅        | Open in new tabs with proper `rel` attributes             |
| Language Icons in Captions | ✅        | Automatically rendered if code block language is detected |
| Inline Code Styling        | ✅        | Uses `<Code>` typography component for inline snippets    |

## Inline Code Examples

When you see something like `const port = 3000;`,
that’s an **inline code** example using the `<Code>` typography component.

### Code with Figcaption & Language Icon

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
};

function getUser(id: string): User {
  return { id, name: "Rohit" };
}
```

## Final Thoughts 💭

This setup isn’t just about looks — it’s about **better communication**.
By combining **good design** with **developer-friendly features**,
I can share articles that are easy to read, easy to use, and fun to explore.

Thanks for joining me on this journey — and get ready for some exciting posts ahead!
