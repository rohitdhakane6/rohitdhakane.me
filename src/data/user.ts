  about: `
Hello, World! I am Rohit Dhakane — a Design Engineer passionate about building high-performance, user-focused software solutions that merge clean design with robust engineering.

With strong expertise in Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Prisma, I specialize in developing scalable, modern web applications. I enjoy tackling complex backend challenges, creating intuitive frontends, and ensuring every detail aligns for a seamless user experience.

Beyond work, I’m constantly exploring new technologies — from real-time WebSocket systems to blockchain integrations on Solana — and bringing ideas to life through personal projects. I’ve worked on diverse applications, including a crypto exchange platform, a Zapier-like automation tool, phishing website detection systems, and advanced form builders.

One of my current focuses, [ExpenseAI](https://expenseai.tech), is designed to make expense tracking smarter with AI-driven insights, aiming to help individuals and businesses save time and money.

I believe in the power of open-source collaboration, continuous learning, and designing solutions that matter. Let’s connect and build something extraordinary!
